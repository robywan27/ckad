Resource
once a resource (e.g. deployment) is created, its info is stored in the etcd db

Controller (written in e.g. Go or Python)
it's an ongoing background process whose job is to:
    - monitor the resource it's tasked of
    - apply changes to resource

resource - controller
replicaSet - replicaSetController
deployment - deploymentController
...

can create Custom Resources and its associated Custom Controllers

Custom Resource Definition (CRD) - tells k8s that we want to define a custom resource

after creating a CRD, it's then possible to perform commands with the custom resource (e.g. k get)

k get crd

k get <new-object>


Custom Controller
after creating a custom resource, it's possible to adjust its behavior via a custom controller



Operator framework
allows to package and deploy the CRD and custom controller together

there's several Operators available (operatorhub.io)
e.g. etcd operator to deploy and manage an etcd cluster
    etcdCluster (CRD) - etcd controller
