It's possible to create service accounts

It's not possible to create users.
User authentication is managed by kube-apiserver




KUBECONFIG
by default k8s looks for a config file in $HOME/.kube

Format:
    clusters - contains the server specification
    users - user accounts to access clusters; admin user key and certificates go in this section
    contexts - define which user accounts access which cluster

No user is created, you use existing ones and only define which clusters they can access

k config view -> view the current config file in use

k config view --kubeconfig=my-custom-config - specify the config file to view

k config use-context prod-user@prod - change current context to specified one
