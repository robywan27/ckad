    /version - to view the version of the cluster
    /api - core group
    /apis - named group
    /metrics - monitor the health of the cluster
    /healthz - monitor the health of the cluster
    /logs - integrating with third-party logging apps

    /v1
        pods
        namespaces
        events

        configmaps
        ...

to look at the kube-apiserver config file
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yml

to access kube-apiserver
curl https://localhost:6443 -k                          -> list groups
    --key admin.key
    --cert admin.crt
    --cacert ca.crt
curl https://localhost:6443 -k ... | grep "name"        -> list resource groups

can use a kubectl proxy that uses credential from the kubeconfig file to access the cluster
k proxy
curl https://localhost:8001 -k                          -> calls the kube-apiserver passing the right credentials
