API Versions
Any API group can support multiple versions:
    /v1 - (GA) means that api is stable
    /v1alpha - not available by default
    /v1beta - has e2e tests

some objects support multiple versions at the same time and you can create distinct objects of each version
    - preferred version - is used by default when calling commands e.g. k get or k explain
    - storage version - is the version in which an object is stored in etcd; an object of a different version is going to be converted to the storage version
preferred and storage versions can be different



API Deprecations

evolution of API: /v1alpha1 -> /v1alpha2 -> ... -> /v1beta1 -> /v1beta2 -> ... -> /v1
older versions can be deleted and deprecated as api evolves (according to certain rules)

Rules:
    1. API elements may only be removed by incrementing the version of the API group
        e.g.: API /webinar is still in /v1alpha1 but is deprecated in /v1alpha2
    2. API objects must be able to round-trip between API versions in a given release without information loss, with the exception of whole REST resources that don't exist in some versions
        e.g.: object Course introduces new field duration in /v1alpha2 but it's not there in /v1alpha1; then this field has to be added to /v1alpha1
    3. an API version in a given track may not be deprecated until a new API version at least as stable is released
        e.g.: /v2alpha1 can't deprecate /v1
    4a. ... older API versions must be supported after their announced deprecation for a duration no less than:
        - GA: 12 months or 3 releases (whichever is longer)
        - beta: 9 months or 3 releases (whichever is longer)
        - alpha: 0 releases
    4b. the preferred api version and the storage version for a given group may not advance until after a release has been made that supports both the new version and the previous version


k convert -f <old-file> --output-version <new-api>
    k convert -f nginx.yml --output-version apps/v1

k convert is a plugin so might need to be installed
