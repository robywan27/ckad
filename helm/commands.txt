Helm works like a package manager and a release manager
it allows to treat your apps as apps instead of a collection of objects
don't need to keep track, edit all yaml files for every single component

helm install app ...
helm upgrade app ...
helm rollback app ...
helm uninstall app ...

there is a single values.yml where you can change all the config you need instead of multiple files



Helm Chart: Templates + values.yml + Chart.yml
template: {{.Values.<name>}}


helm search hub wordpress -> search for existing charts in artifacthub.io; or visit the website directly

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami -> if you want to search in another chart repo you first hav eto add it
helm search repo wordpress -> repo instead of hub

helm repo list

helm install [release-name] [chart-name] - a release is an installation of a repository

helm install release-2 bitnami/wordpress
