k get pods

POD status
    Pending - scheduler tries to figure out on which node to schedule the pod; k describe pod <pod_name> to check why pod is not being created
    ContainerCreating - starts the containers
    Running - after all containers have been started

POD conditions (true/false)
    PodScheduled
    Initialized
    ContainersReady

LOGGING

k logs -f mypod -> show logs live from the pod
k logs -f mypod mycontainer -> if the pod has multiple containers you need to specify from which one to stream the logs



MONITORING

download the metrics server

(via minikube) - minikube addons enable metrics-server

(others) - git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server.git

k create -f deploy/1.8+/ -> deploys some pods, services and roles to enable the metrics server to poll for performance metrics from the cluster

k top node -> provides the cpu and memory consumption of each of the nodes

k top pod -> same for pods
