Patches provide another way to modify k8s configs
Unlike transformers, patches target one or more specific sections in a resource

need to provide 3 params:
    - operation type: add/remove/replace
    - target: which resource to patch
    - value: the value that will be replaced/added

json 6902 patch
    patches:
    - target:
        kind: Deployment
        name: api-deployment
        
        patch: |-     # inline patch
        - op: replace
            path: /spec/replicas
            value: 5

strategic merge patch:
    patches:
    - patch: |-
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
