Kustomize solves use cases such as how can you customize each environment without having to duplicate code
How:
    - base config - represents all config that's identical across all envs and default values
    - overlay - allow to customize behavior on a per env basis
Folder structure
k8s/
    base/
        kustomization.yaml
        nginx-depl.yaml
        redis-deply.yaml
        ...
    overlays/
        dev/
            kustomization.yaml
            config-map.yaml
        stg/
            kustomization.yaml
            config-map.yaml
        prod/
            kustomization.yaml
            config-map.yaml

Kustomize takes base and overlay and generates the final manifest files to provide to the cluster
base + overlay -> final manifests


Helm vs Kustomize
- Kustomize is all about simplicity (no templates), everything is just yaml so can be validated and processed as such
- Helm uses Go templates to allow assigning variables to properties

Folder structure for Helm project
k8s/
    environments/                   assigns values to templates per env
        values.dev.yaml
        values.stg.yaml
        values.prod.yaml
    templates/                      contains manifests with templates in them 
        nginx-depl.yaml
        nginx-service.yaml
        ...

- Helm is also a package manager for your app
- Helm provides extra features like conditionals, loops, functions, hooks
- templates can become hard to read and are not valid yaml
