Components provide the ability to define reusable pieces of configuration logic (resources + patches) that can be included in multiple overlays
useful when apps support multiple optional features that need to be enabled only in a subset of overlays


example:

base/
    kustomization.yaml
    api-depl.yaml
overlays/
    dev/
        kustomization.yaml
    premium/
        kustomization.yaml
    self-hosted/
    kustomization.yaml
components/
    caching/
        kustomization.yaml
        redis-depl.yaml
        deployment-patch.yaml
    db/
        kustomization.yaml
        postgres-depl.yaml
        deployment-patch.yaml


want to enable caching only for: premium, self-hosted
want to enable external db only for: dev, premium
then introduce a components folder where you define the config for the caching and db
overlays can just import those components
