kustomize build k8s/
    -> imports the specified resources and apply customizations to them
    -> output shows the config of the modified resources

- Kustomize looks for a kustomization file which contains:
    - list of all the manifests to manage
    - all the customizations to be applied
- the kustomize build command combines all manifests and applies the defined transformations
- does NOT apply/deploy the resources to a cluster; output needs to be redirected to the k apply command        
    kustomize build k8s/ | kubectl apply -f -

to delete the resources created via kustomize:
    kubectl delete -k k8s/        (-k here is for kustomize)
    OR
    kustomize build k8s/ | kubectl delete -f -



Directories

k apply -f k8s/api/ -> deploys all resources in api/ directory

but if specify in resources all files with the directory name e.g. api/db-depl.yml then:
    kubectl apply -k k8s
deploys all resources from all the sub-directories

best way to handle this: add a kustomization file in every sub-directory, then a root-level kustomization with the list of directories
apply will deploy all resources
    kubectl apply -k k8s
