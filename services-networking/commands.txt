k8s by default defines an All Allow policy which allows traffic to flow between all pods and services in the cluster
Network policies allow to define rules to restrict traffic among pods

k get networkpolicy

k get ingress

k create ingress <ingress-name> --rule="host/path=service:port"
    e.g.: k create ingress ingress-test --rule="wear.my-online-store.com/wear*=wear-service:80"
