k8s by default defines an All Allow policy which allows traffic to flow between all pods and services in the cluster
Network policies allow to define rules to restrict traffic among pods

k get networkpolicy



Ingress
ingress helps a user access your app using a single externally accessible url that you can configure to route traffic to different services within the cluster based on the url path
    and also allows to implement ssl security
it's like a load balancer built into the cluster that can be configured using native k8s primitives as any other k8s object
needs to be exposed to make it accessible outside the cluster (e.g. by a NodePort type of service)

ingress controller (as a sort of reverse proxy such as nginx)
    +
ingress resources (config)


k get ingress

k create ingress <ingress-name> --rule="host/path=service:port"
    e.g.: k create ingress ingress-test --rule="wear.my-online-store.com/wear*=wear-service:80"
