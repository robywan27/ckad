Containers in same POD share:
    lifecycle: created and detroyed at the same time
    network: share the same network so they can refer to each other as localhost
    storage: have access to the same storage volumes

Design patterns:
    - co-located containers: containers are meant to run throughout the pod's lifecycle; these services are dependent on each other
    - regular init containers: there needs to be an initialization step, so one contianer must start before others; this container stops after its' done then other containers start
    - sidecar containers: hybrid, like init containers start first, but after it's done it contains to run throughout pod's lifecycle
