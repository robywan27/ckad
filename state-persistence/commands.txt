Persistent volumes

k create -f pv-definition.yml
k get pv (persistentvolume)


Persistent volume claims:

k create -f pvc-definition.yml
k get pvc (persistentvolumeclaim)
k delete pvc mypvc - if the pvc is in use by a pod then its status is left hanging at Terminating

In this scenario, the created pvc is linked with the pv because the accessMode matches and even though the request of space is lower there are no other pvs
