taints are applied to nodes, tolerations are applied to pods


k taint nodes node-name key==value:taint-effect -> 3 types of effects
    NoSchedule - pods (which don't tolerate node's taint) not scheduled on the node with taint
    PreferNoSchedule - like NoSchedule but with no guarantee
    NoExecute - like NoSchedule but existing pods are also evicted if they don't tolerate the taint

k taint nodes node1 app=myapp:NoSchedule

k taint nodes node1 taint:NoSchedule- -> removes the taint (note - sign at the end)

k8s master node is never scheduled any pod because it has a taint
k describe node kubemaster | grep Taint -> node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
