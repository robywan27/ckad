Requests and Limits
    requests: the request of a resource (e.g. cpu, memory) a container makes
        if there is more resource available in the node, the container can use more resource than its specified request
    limits: defines a threshold to a container for the consumption of a resource
        cpu: limit is imposed by cpu throttling limiting how much cpu is used
        memory: limit is imposed by OOM (out of memory) kills so the container is terminated
