This section regards deployment objects

Types of rollouts: 
    - ROLLING UPDATES - resources in old version go down one by one and resources in new version go up one by one; default deployment strategy
    - RECREATE - everything in old version goes down then every resource in new version goes up
    - BLUE-GREEN - both versions (old = blue, new = green) are deployed and running; traffic is still routed to blue, but once tests pass for green then traffic goes to green
    - CANARY - new version is up and only small percentage of traffic is routed to it; after tests for new version pass, can route traffic to new version (e.g. with rolling update); finally canary goes down and old version too

status
    k rollout status deployment/my-deployment

    k rollout history deploy/my-deployment -> to see the revisions and history
        --revision=n -> check the status of revision n

update
   
    k apply -f config.yml
    
    k set image deploy/my-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1 -> updates image of the app; unlike k apply this command results in a different configuration file
        --record -> save the command used to create/update a deployment against a revision number

rollback
    k rollback undo deploy my-deployment -> new pods will be destroyed and the old pods restored
        --to-revision=n -> roll back to specific revision

scale
    k scale deploy my-deployment --replicas=n
